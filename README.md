# Music Visualizer
In my Creative Coding class my final project was a customizable music visualizer that I made using the Three.JS library to handle 3D animation and sound playback. This project was extremely rewarding to work on and it involved work from outside the discipline of computer science. I flexed my creative muscles by recording the song used in the music visualizer which resulted in my project to be unique and not just a random music visualizer. The blend of song creation and audio visualization resulted in a very unique project that I would not have been able to experience in any other course.
